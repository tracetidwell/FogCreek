Fog Creek Support Engineer

Support Engineer

Customer support? Really? Isn't that what you do when you can't get a job waiting tables? Don't you spend your days making excuses for people who don't want to "deal" with customers?

Being a part of the support team at Fog Creek Software is different.

It's Technical

Being a support engineer at Fog Creek is like no other support position. You'll be a full Member of Technical Staff, working with the product development team, with full benefits from day one.

This is a great job for someone energized by the possibilities offered by programming, but less excited about chasing down weird text-encoding corner cases and poring over billing code. You will be consistently challenged and engaged by diverse and interesting problems. You'll use a constantly changing tool set to solve a constantly changing array of problems. There's room for coding in this position, but you don't have to be a coder to succeed in it.

We give you Slack

The customer-facing employees in an organization often have the best information about pain points in a product, but they're rarely given a spare moment to think about potential improvements.

We believe that you can't think strategically and objectively when you're always being asked to empathize and communicate with customers. We use relentless automation and improvement to give our support team what's referred to as "slack." Slack is breathing room to think about ways to make your job easier or better. Each of our support engineers regularly takes full days, to work on projects that are strategic for the team or company.

Requirements

A broad technical curiosity and proven technical understanding. You've probably dabbled in a bunch of different languages.
Bachelors' degree or equivalent
The ability to communicate clearly and positively through written and spoken English
Remote allowed
Permanent legal right to work in the US for non-remote
One or more of the following skills would be helpful:

Knowledge of distributed version control systems like Mercurial or Git
SQL experience
Internet troubleshooting experience (Fiddler2, Firebug, mad Chrome console skills, etc.)
Working remotely

All of Fog Creek's technical teams are geographically distributed. Every meeting takes place online and almost all of our work-related communication takes place on the Internet (we use Slack, AppearIn, Trello & Google Hangouts). That means that you can work from almost anywhere in the world, provided:

You have access to broadband, stable, low-latency Internet, suitable for videoconferencing
You have a dedicated, quiet place to work
Your workday covers our support desk hours, 9 AM to 5 PM Eastern (1300-2100 GMT), Monday through Friday
We have a way to pay you legally wherever you live
Benefits

Working at Fog Creek
Transparent salaries and no negotiating
Generous family leave policy
401 (k) retirement plan w/ matching
Comprehensive health care for you, your spouse & children
Annual conference budget
Tuition Reimbursement
Monthly stipend toward your home office (remote)
Monthly Gym reimbursement
4 weeks paid vacation
...and while you're in New York:

Free unlimited MetroCard
Free lunch
Free soft drinks and snacks
Our benefits are just the start of how we help our employees succeed. We built our company on treating our people right, and our effort isn’t just the usual tech industry lip service —we're committed to what matters to us, like leading the charge for remote work; making Fog Creek a safe, inclusive space; thorough new employee onboarding; servant leadership, and diversity.

About Fog Creek Software

Fog Creek Software is a small, entrepreneurial software company founded in 2000 by Joel Spolsky & Michael Pryor in New York City.

At Fog Creek we believe the best products come from putting skilled, self-driven, excited people in a room and letting them play. There are no performance reviews, substandard equipment, or micro-management. We don't force technical workers into management to progress their careers. Oh, and there's no bad coffee either.

At Fog Creek, we only work on products that grow organically. We know our employees are brilliant, so we help foster their great ideas and create products from them. A few products that have come from Fog Creek are:

*FogBugz - The world's best bug tracker
*Kiln - a system for distributed version control with Mercurial & Git, or both at once
*Stack Overflow - the largest Q&A site for programmers and a top 50 website in the US.
*Trello - the fastest growing team productivity tool, now a venture backed company with over 16 million users
*HyperDev - the developer playground for building full-stack web apps, fast
